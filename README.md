## Project Euler Problem 25
This is my solution of Project Euler Problem # 25. Written in Python (Version 3+).

##Problem details (from Project Euler)

**Note:** Parenthetical grouped content denotes subscript.
  
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

`F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)`, where `F(1) = 1` and `F(2) = 1`.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

```
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 2
F(4) = 3
F(5) = 5
F(6) = 8
F(7) = 13
F(8) = 21
F(9) = 34
F(10) = 55
F(11) = 89
F(12) = 144
```

The 12th term, `F(12)`, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

##Running

From the command line, enter:

`python3 pe_p25.py`

The program will display the first number in the Fibonacci sequence to hit 1000 digits, and its term number in the sequence.
